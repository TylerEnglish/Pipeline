# Template Pipeline

This project is a template pipeline for data processing, model training, testing, and deployment. It provides a structured setup for developing, testing, and deploying data science or machine learning projects with a focus on automation, code quality, and documentation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- **.github/workflows/**: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD automation.
  - `test.yml`: Runs unit and integration tests automatically.
  - `extract.yml`: Automates data extraction workflow.
  - `push.yml`: Handles deployment tasks.

- **raw_data/**: Contains raw data files and instructions.
  - `README.md`: Instructions for handling raw data.

- **derived_data/**: Contains processed data files and instructions.
  - `README.md`: Instructions for handling processed data.

- **test/**: Test scripts for unit and integration testing.
  - `unit/test_example.py`: Example unit test.
  - `integration/test_example.py`: Example integration test.

- **scripts/**: Core scripts for pipeline operations.
  - `processing.py`: Script for data processing tasks.
  - `training.py`: Script for model training tasks.
  - `validation.py`: Script for data validation tasks.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions for the pipeline.

- **docs/**: Documentation and configuration files.
  - `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the project.

- **Root Files**:
  - `.gitignore`: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in version control.
  - `.env.example`: Template for environment variables.
  - `main.py`: Entry point for pipeline execution.
  - `README.md`: Main readme for project overview.

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Template_Pipeline.git
   cd Template_Pipeline
   ```

2. **Create a virtual enviroment**:

    ```bash

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash

    pip install -r ./docs/requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up enviroment variables**:
    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables

5. **Run the pipeline**:
    - Execute the main pipeline script:

    ```bash

    python main.py
    ```

## How It Works

The `Template_Pipeline` is designed to automate data processing, model training, testing, deployment, and documentation generation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the core workflows:

1. **Data Processing**: The `processing.py` script in the `scripts/` directory handles data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL). This script processes the raw data located in `raw_data/` and generates processed data in `derived_data/`.

2. **Model Training**: The `training.py` script is responsible for training machine learning models using the processed data. It can be customized to fit different algorithms and model architectures.

3. **Testing**: The `test/` directory contains unit and integration tests to ensure the code quality and functionality. The tests are run automatically using GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/test.yml`).
  
4. **Deployment**: The `push.yml` workflow defines the steps for deploying the trained models or applications.

## Security Considerations

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and secret keys should be stored in environment variables. Use the `.env.example` file as a template, and do not commit the `.env` file to version control.

- **Access Control**: Ensure that only authorized users have access to the repository, especially when it contains sensitive data or credentials.

- **Data Security**: Be mindful of the size and sensitivity of data files. Avoid committing large files directly into the repository. Consider using external storage solutions for large datasets.
