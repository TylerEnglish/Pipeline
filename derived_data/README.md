# Derived Data

This directory contains processed data files that are generated as outputs from the data processing and analysis pipelines.

## Files

- **processed_data.csv**: A sample processed data file resulting from running the data processing pipeline on the raw data. This file represents the cleaned and transformed data ready for analysis or further use.

## Guidelines

1. **Data Format**: All processed data should be in approated formats and maintain consistency with naming conventions and schema.
2. **Updating Data**: If the processed data files are updated, document the changes, including the date and a brief description of the modifications.

## Usage

- Processed data in this directory is typically used as input for further analysis, modeling, or visualization tasks.
- The processed data files are generated by running scripts such as `processing.py` in the `scripts/` directory.

## Additional Notes

- Always maintain a backup of processed data files to ensure reproducibility and traceability of the analysis.
- This directory can be both read and write-enabled, but modifications should be done carefully to prevent data loss or inconsistency.
